# nlp_2024_us_election
This project explores data lakes and NLP to analyze media coverage of the 2024 US Presidential Election. Using Google Drive as a pseudo data lake, it ingests data via APIs, processes it with PySpark, and applies sentiment, entity, and topic analysis using DuckDB and NLP models, while working within computational limits.
